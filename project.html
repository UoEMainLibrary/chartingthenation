      <h3 id='main'>About the Project</h3>
      <p>Charting the Nation is a collaborative digital
        imaging and cataloguing project with the primary aim of widening access 
        to maps of Scotland and their associated texts dating from ca.
        1550 to 1740.</p>
      <p>This three-year project (1999-2002) was funded by a major
        award to the University of Edinburgh from the <a href="http://www.rslp.ac.uk/" target ="_blank">Research 
        Support Libraries Programme<span class='sr-only'> (Opens in a new tab)</span></a> (RSLP), on behalf of the Scottish Higher
        Education Funding Council (SHEFC). Additional funding was received 
        from the Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network (<a href=
"http://www.scran.ac.uk" target ="_blank">SCRAN<span class='sr-only'> (Opens in a new tab)</span></a>) and the National Library of Scotland.</p>
      <p>Although Charting the Nation is now managed by Edinburgh University Library,
			 the development phase took place within the University's Department of Geography. The project involves
			  a core consortium of 9 other higher education and national institutions within the United 
        Kingdom:</p>

      <h5>Why Charting the Nation?</h5>
      <p>Charting the Nation is important because of
        the significance of historic maps and related textual material for research 
        and education in numerous disciplines. These include historical geography, 
        cartographic history, maritime history, architectural history, archaeology, 
        environmental history, and even for research on the evolution of ideas 
        about the shape of the nation itself.</p>
      <p>However, many of the map and archive sources relating
        to the cartographic history of Scotland are fragile, unique, and rare. 
        As a result, holding institutions have not been able hitherto to make 
        them as widely available to researchers as they might wish. An additional 
        problem for researchers has been the wide dispersion of the maps throughout 
        the UK, and the fact that many related textual archives are located in 
        different institutions hundreds of miles apart. Charting the Nation
        brings all these related materials together in an innovative and accessible 
        way.</p>
      <h5>The time period: 1550-1740</h5>
      <p>At its inception, the project was planned to incorporate
        maps and relevant textual archival material dating from post 1590, the 
        period immediately following the late sixteenth century field mapping 
        of much of Scotland by Timothy Pont (1565 or 6-ca. 1614). The
        work of Pont was the subject of a major 5 year research project (<a href="http://www.nls.uk/pont/index.html" target ="_blank">Project 
        Pont<span class='sr-only'> (Opens in a new tab)</span></a>) from 1996 to 2001. That project was led by the National Library
        of Scotland, but it also involved several higher education institutions 
        including the Department of Geography of the University of Edinburgh. 
        Digital images of <a href="http://www.nls.uk/pont/index.html" target ="_blank">Pont's
        manuscript maps<span class='sr-only'> (Opens in a new tab)</span></a> are available at the National
        Library of Scotland web site. In practice, Charting the Nation
        has been able to incorporate a significant number items that pre-date the work of 
        Pont, the earliest of which is currently a manuscript map of the English/Scottish 
        border, dated 1552 (image no: 00003444).</p>

      <p>The formal end date of 1740 was chosen for the project
        because it is recognised that during the 1740s there was a 'new beginning' 
        for mapping in Scotland (and indeed in Britain), a development characterised 
        by adoption of 'standard' mapping practices by the Military Survey under 
        General William Roy. (<a href="http://maps.nls.uk/geo/roy" target="_blank">The important Roy
        map is now available online<span class='sr-only'> (Opens in a new tab)</span></a>, courtesy of the British Library and SCRAN).
        Again, however, in practice a number of maps from the later eighteenth 
        century have been included in Charting the Nation, in particular
        a significant body of manuscript estate plans that cannot be dated with 
        certainty.</p>
