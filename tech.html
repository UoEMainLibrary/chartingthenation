      <h4 id='main'>Technical Specification (for images created locally by the Charting the Nation project
        team)<sup>(<a href="#one">1</a>)</sup><a name="top1"></a> </h4>

      <p>Phase One PowerPhase&#153;</p>
      <p> Resolution: 7072 x 7072 pixels </p>
      <p> Uninterpolated files (max 143.3 Mb; min 300ppi)</p>
      <p>56mm x 56mm frame capture area</p>
      <p>42bit internal colour depth, 14 bit per colour precision</p>
      <p><strong>Native File format</strong>: Uncompressed TIFF
        files with optional Motorola (Mac) or Intel (PC) byte order and header 
        version 6</p>
      <p><strong>Capture software</strong>: Phase One version
        3.1.1 for Power Macintosh</p>
      <p><strong>Camera body</strong>: Hasselblad 501CM</p>
      <p><strong>Lens</strong>: Zeiss 80mm (plus 8mm and 16mm
        extension tubes for close-up work)</p>
      <p><strong>Capture</strong>: Power Mac G4 400Mhz/Apple 21
        inch Studio Monitor with ColorSync</p>
      <p><strong>Post-capture edits</strong>: Adobe Photoshop
        5.0</p>
      <p><strong>Test charts</strong>: Industry standard Kodak
        Q13 colour separation guide (with metric and imperial scales) and grey 
        scale for reflected work; Kodak Q60 target for 5x4 transparencies</p>
      <p><strong>Archiving and delivery solutions</strong>: Sony
        DAT DDS3 12Gb tapes (stored off-site) and CD-R Kodak Gold Ultima 650Mb 
        (<a href="#two">2</a>) (stored on-site)<a name="top2"></a>. Copies of 
        each CD-R were provided to the contributing institutions. Discs were written 
        to ISO 660/Joliet format. Kodak claims longevity of 100 years</p>
      <p><strong>Lighting</strong>: 2 Photon Beard 'Highlight'
        studio lights: these are cool running, flicker free, 5,400k balanced fluorescent 
        lamps, with a variable output of 2 tubes (110W), 4 tubes (220W), or 6 
        tubes (330W). This high colour rendering index (Ra 98) (<a href="#three">3</a>) 
        <a name="top3"></a>light source is designed for digital imaging. The lights 
        are fitted with Perspex safety screens<br>
        <strong>Light levels</strong>: Using just 4 tubes per light, the measure 
        of Lux @ 1m = 10,666 and at 2m = 3,332. Thus at 1m for 15 minutes the 
        item being imaged would be subject to 2,666 lux-hrs. (By comparison, the 
        standard museum light level for sensitive works on paper is 50 lux. For 
        6 weeks display at this level (6-day week, 12-hour day) the object would 
        be subject to 26,500 lux-hrs per exhibition). Also, the lights are equipped 
        with reflective barn door units. These are employed to screen the object 
        from light outside the actual scanning periods, thus reducing light exposure 
        to an estimated 2,000 lux-hrs<br>
        <strong>Heat rise</strong>: A preview scan is obtained in circa 15 seconds. 
        The scan time for a full high resolution (143Mb) image file is typically 
        5-6 minutes using 4 tubes per light. The rise in temperature at the surface 
        of the copy table during a typical 15 minute total scanning period using 
        4 tubes per light at 1m (i.e. 10,666 Lux) at no time exceeds 1.25 degrees 
        C. Tests on-site show that the temperature at the object point on the 
        copy table is not more than 1.5 degrees C above the ambient temperature 
        of the room at any time<br>
        When used on-site the lights are suspended from an IFF top rail system 
        with pantographs. Off-site, the lights are mounted on portable Manfrotto Master 
        Stands<br>
        For 5 x 4 transparency copying a Larn electronic high-frequency (cool, 
        no-flicker, optimum colour balance, 5300K) lightbox is employed. Transparencies 
        are stored in acid-free envelopes</p>
      <p><strong>Archival equipment</strong>: Copy table with
        matt black, soft velvet top surface; Clarkson book supports for bound 
        items (large and medium sets), plus snakes; unbleached pure cotton gloves</p>
