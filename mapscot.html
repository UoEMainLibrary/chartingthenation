      <h3 id='main'>Mapping Scotland</h3>
      <p>Maps are one of the most ancient and most modern products.
        All human beings acquire knowledge of their surroundings through personal 
        encounter and communication with others. Transforming these 'mental maps' 
        into artefacts- essentially, making a map as something to extend memory 
        and which may be made sense of by others- arguably predates writing. 
        Yet our understanding of a map as a scaled representation of the real 
        world designed in standardised ways is relatively recent. Maps, then, 
        are complex cultural creations that need to be understood in the context 
        of the times and peoples who made them.</p>
      <p>The maps and manuscripts collected here for Scotland
        between c.1550 and c.1740 are not the work of Scots alone.
        Mapmaking was a European, even a worldwide, practice at this time. In 
        order to provide background to the material and to appreciate why mapping 
        was so widespread in what we may term the 'early modern period', this 
        introduction provides a brief summary of what maps meant and for whom 
        in the period covered by Charting the Nation. The first part of
        this introduction summarises the map history of Scotland before 1550 and 
        after 1740. The second outlines the nature of maps and of mapmaking in 
        the early modern period, noting the different sorts of maps produced and 
        the purposes behind them. A short guide to further reading is included.</p>
      <p><h4>Maps and mapping in Scotland </h4></p>
      <p>The earliest known representation of Scotland in map
        form is in the map of the British Isles in the eight-book Geographia
        of Claudius Ptolemaeus (known as Ptolemy) who lived between c.90
        and c.150 A.D. For reasons that are unclear, Scotland is correctly
        placed to the north of England in this map, but instead of a largely northwards 
        orientation, the country is shown tilted eastwards. Ptolemy's Scotland 
        may be inaccurately mapped, but the 're-discovery' of Ptolemy's Geographia
        and its publication in Renaissance Italy from 1477 revolutionised the 
        nature of global and large-scale geographical representation. Differences 
        between his claims and the direct experience of the world reported by 
        Renaissance navigators and geographers raised questions of a conceptual 
        and practical nature concerning the shape and extent of the world. </p>
      <p>The earliest printed map of Scotland on its own, 'Scotia'
        (see image 00000364), dates from about 1564. Although the map derives 
        from one of Britain produced in 1546 by George Lily, 'Scotia', is probably 
        engraved by Paolo Forlani, who was known to have worked in Venice, then 
        an important centre for mapmaking. At much the same time, Alexander Lyndsay, 
        a Scottish coasting pilot, produced a map of Scotland in association with 
        King James V's partial circumnavigation of the country in 1540, although 
        the map was not published until 1583 (image 00001374). From the later 
        1580s, Timothy Pont was engaged in mapping Scotland. The surviving manuscript 
        maps and textual accounts of his endeavours provide one of the most detailed 
        map records of any European country in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth 
        centuries. <a href="http://www.nls.uk/pont" target="_blank">Pont's maps<span class='sr-only'> (Opens in a new tab)</span></a> formed the basis
        of Joan Blaeu's maps of Scotland in his Atlas Novus, published
        in Amsterdam in 1654. These maps constituted the first atlas of Scotland.</p>
      <p>From the later seventeenth century, royal and civil recognition
        of the importance of maps was evident in Scotland in the appointment of 
        Sir Robert Sibbald as Geographer Royal from 1682, and in the funding of 
        John Adair by the Privy Council and the Parliament of Scotland to undertake 
        the country's mapping. The important work of these men and others in the 
        late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries is clear from the cartographic 
        and textual material included in Charting the Nation.</p>
      <p>From the second half of the eighteenth century, a 'new
        beginning' for map-making was apparent in Scotland in the rise of estate 
        maps and, between 1747 and 1755, in the work of the Military Survey. By 
        the turn of the nineteenth century, estate maps undertaken to new levels 
        of surveyed accuracy, institutionalised support for national mapping and 
        charting in the work of the Ordnance Survey and of the Hydrographic Office 
        of the Admiralty, and the common usage of standard scales and practices 
        for mapping signalled the appearance of the 'modern' map.</p>
      <p>Scotland's map history is, however, neither unique in
        these terms nor a linear progression from the 'inaccuracy' of Ptolemaic 
        representations to the 'truthful' precision of standardised Ordnance Survey 
        sheets. Far from being mirrors of the world, maps reflect particular political 
        and cultural concerns and have symbolic values as well as practical utility. 
        Questions of accuracy must be allied to matters of meaning and questions 
        of map-making always related to those of map using. What characterised 
        Scotland's mapping between c.1550 and c.1740 is typical
        of wider changes throughout Europe.</p>
      <p><h4>Scotland's early modern mapping in historical context</h4></p>
      <p>From the mid sixteenth century, the effects of the voyages
        of reconnaissance, new understandings of the extent of the habitable globe 
        and the growing recognition by statesmen of the practical utility of mapping 
        all combined to lend new power to maps. For administrative and for symbolic 
        reasons, governments and kings needed to know the bounds of their territory. 
        Landlords wanted estate maps. Maps had strategic and commercial value. 
        They had cultural significance too. In the new Protestant Bible from Calvin's 
        Geneva, maps helped understand the written Word. Maps became an object 
        of status, of courtly power and of domestic display.</p>
      <p>Maps became important in early modern Europe because
        they were documents that measured, visualised and symbolised power over 
        space. We should note, however, three interrelated 'modes' of mapmaking: 
        maritime charting; small-scale mapping of the world or of its regions 
        (properly, 'chorography', and, in mapping terms, 'topographical mapping'); 
        and large-scale surveying of the land. In early modern Europe (unlike 
        in later periods), the distinction between these modes was never hard 
        and fast.</p>
      <p>Commercial map publishing emerged in north-west Europe
        in the mid-sixteenth century. Many of the large multi-volume atlases and 
        maritime charts - the latter reflecting the sea-borne commerce of the 
        French, the Spanish, Dutch and the English, for example - were initially 
        expensive productions affordable only by a wealthy few. In time, however, 
        cartographic literacy and the prevalence of maps increased because humanist 
        education, printing, and the commodification of land at home and abroad 
        familiarised Europeans with maps and with how they worked. By the mid 
        seventeenth century, there were four interrelated groups of mapmaking 
        practitioners: mariners, intellectual geographers, commercial publishers 
        and land measurers. After about 1660, initially in France and Britain, 
        the increased intervention of the state in the large-scale surveying of 
        their lands means that a fifth group can be identified: 'professional 
        geographers' or, in more detail, military and state surveyors. The work 
        of such men is particularly clear, for example, in the first Cassini survey 
        of France between 1680 and 1744. From the mid eighteenth century in Europe 
        and in overseas colonies, new standardised forms of mapping further secured 
        the intellectual, practical and political importance of maps as ways of 
        knowing and showing space.</p>
      <p>These issues are all apparent in the four main sets of
        maps incorporated and represented in the Charting the Nation collection:
        maritime mapping (including coastal charting); estate and topographical 
        mapping; chorographical mapping; and, from the early eighteenth century 
        on, maps relating to the Board of Ordnance with their expressed intention 
        of military survey and topographical portrayals of landscape and roads. 
        It is noteworthy that much of the maritime mapping is Dutch in provenance. 
        Some items, such as Waghenaer's map of the east coast of Scotland, Beschrijvinge
        van een deel vann Schottlandt, 1586 (image 00001483) show in stylised
        form a topographical view of the eastern Scottish coastline as it would 
        have appeared to sailors and merchants sailing westwards from Low Country 
        ports. Other more decorative features on this map - as on many others 
        - symbolise the map as an instrument of commerce. Part of John Adair's 
        brief following the 1686 Act of the Scottish Parliament in his favour 
        was to provide more detailed maps of the coasts as an aid to Scotland's 
        maritime trade.</p>
      <p>Although estate mapping in Scotland is more apparent
        from the second half of the eighteenth century, and is so because of advances 
        in Scotland's agrarian economy from that period, the evidence of earlier 
        estate maps - the earliest here, a coloured plan of Arniston (image 00001586) 
        drawn to illustrate a legal dispute between two landowners and dating 
        from 1586 - is testimony to the importance of maps as practical records 
        of land administration in early modern Scotland.</p>
      <p>Small-scale chorographical mapping as an expression of
        political authority is apparent, for example, in Robert Gordon's 'Scotia 
        Regnum' (image 00000383) that appears in volume V of Blaeu's Atlas
        Novus (1654). As a genre of mapping in Scotland, it is continued by
        others in the second half of the seventeenth century. In the eighteenth 
        century, men such as Herman Moll demonstrate the widespread and continued 
        interest in small-scale mapping, an interest apparent in the large numbers 
        of such maps produced outside Scotland. </p>
      <p>Military unrest associated with Jacobitism, notably from
        the early eighteenth century, lent added significance to the state's need 
        to know who, and what, was where. The Jacobite Rebellion of 1745 prompted 
        the Military Survey of Scotland begun in 1747 (<a href="http://www.scran.ac.uk/scotland/roy-map/index.php" target="_blank">Link to the major outcome of this
        survey, William Roy's map<span class='sr-only'> (Opens in a new tab)</span></a>). It is clear
        from the Board of Ordnance material incorporated here, however, that maps 
        and plans of military installations were understood as a strategic necessity 
        well before and long after 1745. </p>
      <p>What is also discernable from the Board of Ordnance material
        is a different sense of topographic visualisation. This is not merely 
        a different concern for geometric accuracy. It is almost a different language 
        of mapmaking. There are parallels with late seventeenth-century representations 
        such as those of John Slezer (see image 00000745, Dunotter Castle (1675); 
        and Slezer's Theatrum Scotiae (1693)). But this mapping style has
        more in common with those new 'ways of seeing' and of mapping that characterise 
        the modernising Scotland of the later eighteenth century than with earlier 
        work.</p>
      <p><h4>Guide to Further Reading</h4></p>
      <p>The best summary of Scottish map history as a whole remains
        Donald G. Moir (ed.), The Early Maps of Scotland to 1850, 2 vols
        (Edinburgh, 1973-83). The period covered by Charting the Nation is
        chiefly discussed in volume I: volume II has a short section on early 
        maritime mapping. The holdings records in these volumes are, however, 
        not up-to-date. A useful guide to secondary literature on maps and mapping 
        prior to the Ordnance Survey in Scotland is John N. Moore, The Historical
        Cartography of Scotland (Aberdeen, 1991). Timothy Pont's maps of Scotland
        are discussed in Jeffrey Stone, The Pont Manuscript Maps of Scotland:
        sixteenth century origins of a Blaeu Atlas (Tring, 1989) and in Ian
        C. Cunningham (ed.), The Nation Survey'd: Essays on late sixteenth-century
        Scotland as depicted by Timothy Pont (East Linton, 2001). </p>
      <p>One accessible history of Scotland's mapping is Margaret
        Wilkes' The Scot and his Maps (Motherwell, 1991) and another forthcoming. 
        A scholarly account of mapping as part of the history of geographical 
        enquiry in Scotland is given in Charles W. J. Withers, Geography, Science
        and National Identity: Scotland since 1520 (Cambridge, 2001). </p>
      <p>The history of maps and mapping in the early modern period
        more generally has been the subject of several studies. On England, for 
        example, see Catherine Delano-Smith and Roger Kain, English Maps: A
        History (London and Toronto, 1999). For France, see Joseph Konvitz,
        Cartography in France 1660-1848: Science, Engineering and Statecraft
        (Chicago, 1987). For Spain and the mapping of Spanish territory in
        the New World, see Barbara Mundy, The Mapping of New Spain: Indigenous
        Cartography and Maps of the Relaciones Geograficas (Chicago, 1996).
        The studies in David Buisseret (ed.), Monarchs, Ministers and Maps:
        The Emergence of Cartography as a Tool of Government in Early Modern Europe 
        (Chicago, 1992) discuss for other European nations the issues summarised
        here for Scotland. </p>
      <p>An excellent short summary of the historiography of map
        history is to be found in Matthew Edney, 'Cartography: disciplinary history', 
        in Gregory A. Good (ed.), Sciences of the Earth: An Encyclopedia of
        Events, People and Phenomena, 2 vols (New York, 1998), I: 81-5, and
        I have drawn upon this for some of my remarks above. See also his 'Cartography 
        without 'progress': reinterpreting the nature and historical development 
        of mapmaking', Cartographica, 30, nos. 2, 3 (1993), 54-68. The
        important work of Brian Harley on map history, for the period covered 
        by Charting the Nation and more generally, is apparent in his 'Secrecy
        and silences: the hidden agenda of state cartography in early modern Europe', 
        Imago Mundi, 11 (1988), 111-130, and in his 'Maps, knowledge and
        power', in Denis E. Cosgrove and Stephen J. Daniels (eds), The Iconography
        of Landscape (Cambridge, 1988), 277-312.</p>
